# StockAnalysis
C++ Project to analyze stock ticker info
This project contains two files that are used for processing a database of stock tick data
The first file, GenerateStockFiles, is a helper file that will generate a set of csv files each corresponding to one stock's data.
The second file, ProcessStockData, processes the data and returns a list of insights such as average trade price, trade quantity, and time between trades
